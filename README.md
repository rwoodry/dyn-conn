# dyn-conn
Dynamic Connectivity pipeline scripts. So far reads in specific fMRI data by subject (exploration phase bold data), and runs it through a pipeline to spit out a binary thresholded node-node adjacency matrix for use in the Dynamic Connectivity Matlab toolbox. [IN THE WORKS]

This is for use in the Spatial Neuroscience Lab at UC Irvine, for the Maze Learning Individual Differences Task (MLINDIV).
